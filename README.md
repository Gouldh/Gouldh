I am committed to leveraging my academic background and skills to make a meaningful impact in the tech and finance industries.

## üìö Education

- **B.Sc in Computer Science and Mathematics**, Union College, Schenectady, New York
  - Minor: Financial and Actuarial Mathematics
  - Expected Graduation: June 2026
  - Honors: Dean‚Äôs list 2022-2023, Presidential Scholarship, Best Cybersecurity Hack at Hack RPI X, Perfect 36 on the ACT
  - Campus Involvement: Sector Leader in SIF, Member of the Mathematics Problem Solving Group, Member of ACM-W, Member of AWM, and Peer Notetaker for students with disabilities.

## üìä Projects

- **Portfolio Analysis Suite**:
   - Developed a Python-based tool that extends previous [portfolio optimization](https://github.com/Gouldh/Portfolio-Analysis-Suite) frameworks, integrating mean-variance optimization, machine learning strategies, and Black-Litterman model adjustments. Utilized `yfinance` for sourcing financial data, `numpy` and `pandas` for advanced data analytics, and `sklearn` for predictive modeling. 
   - Generated comprehensive visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, enabling intuitive comparison and analysis of various investment strategies, including risk-adjusted returns and portfolio diversification impacts.
   - Implemented factor analysis using `statsmodels` to evaluate the influence of market risk factors on portfolio returns. Successfully optimized portfolio allocations under various market conditions, improving Sharpe Ratios and Sortino Ratios by over 50%, and improving Information Ratios by over 35% in simulated environments.
   - Technologies: `python`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn` `yfinance`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`
   - üîó [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Gouldh/ML-Portfolio-Optimization)
 
- **Options Pricing Heatmap**:
   - Developed a financial analysis tool in Python for calculating option prices using Black-Scholes, Heston, and Merton Jump Diffusion models. Employed `numpy` for mathematical computations and `scipy` for statistical functions.
   - Implemented simulation-based approaches for the Heston model to analyze stochastic volatility and the Merton Jump Diffusion model to account for abrupt price jumps in asset pricing.
   - Created a heatmap visualization using `matplotlib` to depict option prices across various volatilities and interest rates, enhancing the interpretability and visualization of complex financial data.
   - Adapted the project into a C++ version using `boost` libraries, focusing on the core option pricing functionalities without the graphing capabilities, to compare and enhance performance.
   - Technologies: `python`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `C++`, `boost`
   - üîó [Github Repository (Python)](https://github.com/Gouldh/Option-Pricing-Heatmap), üîó [Github Repository (C++)](https://github.com/Gouldh/Option-Pricing-CPP)

- **Cryptographic Algorithms Education Tool**:
   - Developed an interactive Python-based cryptographic toolkit at RPI Hack X, showcasing Diffie-Hellman, Elgamal, and RSA algorithms. Utilized `numpy` and `sympy` for mathematical computations and `PyQt/PySide6` for the GUI.
   - Collaborated in a three-person team to implement various cryptosystems and visualize cryptographic processes. Focused on practical application, achieving secure message exchange, key exchange and digital signature functionality.
   - Presented in front of over 300 participants and a panel of judges, winning the Major Prize Track for Best Cybersecurity Hack, demonstrating effective teaching of digital security measures to a broad audience.
   - Technologies: `python`, `numPy`, `sympy`, `pyqt/pyside6`

## üîç Research
- **Probability Theory Research**:
   - Assisting Professor Phanuel Mariano with research in the field of probability theory during the winter term of 2023-2024.

## üíº Work Experience

- **Quantitative Research Analyst, Intern**, USA Mutuals, Boston, Massachusetts
  - Leveraged a python-based echo state network, a form of recurrent neural network that utilizes reservoir computing, as a means of predicting non-stationary bursty dynamics; Utilized `numpy` and `pandas` for data transformation, `matplotlib` for output, and `yfinance` for financial data sourcing.
  - Collaborated with Arnold Englander, portfolio co-manager and director of research at USA Mutuals, to implement a trading strategy based on the echo state network. Currently working on publishing our findings.

- **Investment Analyst, Intern**, USA Mutuals, Boston, Massachusetts
  - Used market research and fundamental analysis to choose stocks for the VICEX fund. Worked closely with president and senior portfolio manager of USA Mutuals, Paul Strehle, in determining high-performing stocks.
  - Assisted the marketing team by revising and rewriting press releases to ensure adherence to SEC regulations, focusing on accuracy and clarity in financial disclosures.
  - Contributed to Investment Strategies that coincided with a 13.85% fund return over the subsequent three months, and a 16.67% profit in the subsequent 6 months.

## üîß Skills & Tools

- **Programming**: `Python`, `Java`, `R`, `LaTeX`.
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: `numpy`, `scipy`, `sympy`, `matplotlib`, `yfinance`.
