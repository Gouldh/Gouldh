# üìå Hello, I'm Hunter Gould!

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/Gouldh/Gouldh/raw/main/pfp.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" width="350px">

As a Computer Science and Mathematics major at Union College, I am deeply passionate about quantitative research, financial analysis, machine learning, and algorithmic problem-solving. I am committed to leveraging my academic background and skills to make a meaningful impact in the tech and finance industries.

## üìö Education

- **B.Sc in Computer Science and Mathematics**, Union College, Schenectady, New York
  - Minor: Financial and Actuarial Mathematics
  - Expected Graduation: June 2026
  - Honors: Dean‚Äôs list 2022-2023, Presidential Scholarship, Best Cybersecurity Hack at Hack RPI X, Perfect 36 on the ACT
  - Campus Involvement: Sector Leader in SIF, Member of the Mathematics Problem Solving Group, Member of ACM-W, Member of AWM, and Peer Notetaker for students with disabilities.
  - **Selected Coursework**: Probability Theory, Linear Algebra, Data Structures & Algorithms, Portfolio Management
 

## üìä Projects

- **Portfolio Analysis Suite**:
   - Engineered a Python suite for financial portfolio analysis as an expansion on a previous portfolio optimization project, applying Modern Portfolio Theory through Monte Carlo simulations to optimize a given portfolio for Sharpe ratio, utilizing `yfinance` for financial data sourcing, `numpy` for computation, and `pandas` for data processing.
   - Implemented backtesting, allowing for measuring of performance for any optimization over a chosen time period, visualizing probability distributions using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` in order to offer comparison between a median volatility portfolio, the optimized portfolio, the given portfolio, and the market representation.
   - Technologies: `Python`, `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Yfinance`, `Seaborn`
   - üîó [Github Repository](https://github.com/Gouldh/Portfolio-Analysis-Suite)
 
- **Options Pricing Heatmap**:
   - Developed a financial analysis tool in Python for calculating option prices using Black-Scholes, Heston, and Merton Jump Diffusion models. Employed `numpy` for mathematical computations and `scipy` for statistical functions.
   - Implemented simulation-based approaches for the Heston model to analyze stochastic volatility and the Merton Jump Diffusion model to account for abrupt price jumps in asset pricing.
   - Created a heatmap visualization using `matplotlib` to depict option prices across various volatilities and interest rates, enhancing the interpretability and visualization of complex financial data.
   - Technologies: `Python`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Matplotlib`

- **Cryptographic Algorithms Education Tool**:
   - Developed an interactive Python-based cryptographic toolkit at RPI Hack X, showcasing Diffie-Hellman, Elgamal, and RSA algorithms. Utilized `numpy` and `sympy` for mathematical computations and `PyQt/PySide6` for the GUI.
   - Collaborated in a three-person team to implement various cryptosystems and visualize cryptographic processes. Focused on practical application, achieving secure message exchange, key exchange and digital signature functionality.
   - Presented in front of over 300 participants and a panel of judges, winning the Major Prize Track for Best Cybersecurity Hack, demonstrating effective teaching of digital security measures to a broad audience.
   - Technologies: `Python`, `NumPy`, `SymPy`, `PyQt/PySide6`

## üîç Research
- **Probability Theory Research**:
   - Assisting Professor Phanuel Mariano with research in the field of probability theory during the winter term of 2023-2024.

## üíº Work Experience

- **Quantitative Research Analyst, Intern**, USA Mutuals, Boston, Massachusetts
  - Leveraged a python-based echo state network, a form of recurrent neural network that utilizes reservoir computing, as a means of predicting non-stationary bursty dynamics; Utilized `numpy` and `pandas` for data transformation, `matplotlib` for output, and `yfinance` for financial data sourcing.
  - Collaborated with Arnold Englander, portfolio co-manager and director of research at USA Mutuals, to implement a trading strategy based on the echo state network. Currently working on publishing our findings.

- **Investment Analyst, Intern**, USA Mutuals, Boston, Massachusetts
  - Used market research and fundamental analysis to choose stocks for the VICEX fund. Worked closely with president and senior portfolio manager of USA Mutuals, Paul Strehle, in determining high-performing stocks.
  - Assisted the marketing team by revising and rewriting press releases to ensure adherence to SEC regulations, focusing on accuracy and clarity in financial disclosures.
  - Contributed to Investment Strategies that coincided with a 13.85% fund return over the subsequent three months, and a 16.67% profit in the subsequent 6 months.

## üîß Skills & Tools

- **Programming**: `Python`, `Java`, `R`, `LaTeX`.
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `SymPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Yfinance`.
